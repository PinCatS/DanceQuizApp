# DanceQuizApp

DanceQuizApp is an adnroid application (min API level 21).
It was my solution for the Project 3 of the Udacity Android Basics nanodegree program.
The goal of the project was to come up with the quiz topic, design and finally implement the app using Control components and following coding best practices and material design recommendations.

During that project I got an experience working with such components like AppBar, SeekBar, EditText, CheckBox, Radio Button, Radio Group, button as well as Relative, Linear and Scroll Layouts.
I also practiced in localization, styles, theme topics and api levels nuances.
